# MindMup MapJs

MindMup is a zero-friction mind map canvas. Our aim is to create the most productive mind mapping environment out there, removing all the distractions and providing powerful editing shortcuts.

|[![Example Map](docs/mapjs-example-screenshot.png)](docs/legacy-mapjs-example-map.html "Example Map")|
|----------------------------|

This project is the JavaScript visualisation portion of MindMup. It provides a canvas for users to create and edit mind maps in a browser. You can see an example of this live at [mindmup.com](https://www.mindmup.com), or play with the library directly in the browser using `test/index.html` from this project.

This project is relatively stand alone and you can use it to create a nice mind map visualisation separate from the [MindMup Server](https://www.mindmup.com).

## Using MAPJS standalone

To run the dev server, execute:

`npm run start`

Then open <http://localhost:9000/> to view the example map.

## Using MAPJS in your projects

MapJS 2 works well with WebPack. Check out the [MAPJS Webpack Example](https://github.com/mindmup/mapjs-webpack-example) project.

Or just use: `npm run pack`

## Using MAPJS with argmap

argmap integrates with MAPJS:

[argmap](https://github.com/s6mike/argmap/tree/master)

Though currently, most of this integration is not on the main branch.

## Using MAPJS with argview (online site)

Additional features added for argview (although this is currently only available in argview repo):

As well as being uploaded and downloaded locally, maps can be saved online for ease of access and collaboration by clicking the save button.

When a map is loaded from a json file generated from `argmap.yaml` data, argview will check whether a more recent version of the same file (identified using the `original_root_node_title`) has been saved online, in which case this version will automatically be downloaded.

Online maps can be controlled using these url parameters:

- `ornt=[original_root_node_title]`. This is the original name of the topmost root in the argument map. It's saved as a property in the mapjs json file.
- `map_id=[map_hash]`: `[map_hash]` being the first 10 characters of a SHA256 hash of `[original_root_node_title]`. This is saved as a property in the mapjs json file.
- `keep_original=true`: Stops check for a more recent online version of the original map.

See [mapjs-json.json](schemas/v3-2/mapjs-json.json) for the `mapjs-json` data format schema.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, execute

    `npm test`

To debug and try things out visually, grab the dependencies using:

    `npm run pretest`

## Dependencies

This library depends on the following projects:

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Underscore.Js](https://underscorejs.org/)
- [JQuery HotKeys](https://jquery.com/)
- [Hammer.JS JQuery Plugin](https://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js)
- [Color JS](https://github.com/harthur/color)

As of 23 Nov 22, it runs with the latest versions of all of these, except [Hammer.JS JQuery Plugin](https://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js) v2.0.0, which requires an insecure version of jQuery, so instead uses v1.1.3.

## Node Selection

- You can only select one node at a time, selected nodes have a drop shadow.
  - When you add nodes they are added relative to th selected node.
- You can activate multiple nodes at once, these are highlighted with a dotted line.
  - When you delete or toggle nodes, this affects all active nodes.

## Node Editing

- New nodes automatically give you text focus so you can start adding its initial text.
- Clicking on a node twice lets you edit the node's text.
- Typing in a url will add a clickable link icon to the node allowing you to open that url in another tab. The url's text will not be displayed in the node except when editing it.
- You can add an image to a node by dragging a file or web page image into it.

## Links

- Links are arbitrary straight line connections between nodes that are not part of the tree structure.
- You can create them with `alt+click` or with the `add link` toolbar button.
- You can select links by clicking on them:
  - This displays the Edit Link buttons underneath the main toolbar buttons:
    - These can be used to delete the link or change their colour, style or toggle an arrow.
  - The selected link is highlighted with a dotted purple line.

## Mouse Operations

- Click inside a node to select it.
- Click twice inside a node to edit the text.
- `shift+click`: Activates a node.
- Menu Toolbar at top has buttons for a number of operations, yet to be documented.
- Dragging and dropping:
  - Root nodes only: drag into an open space to re-position.
  - Child nodes: Make it into a new root node by dragging it into open space.
  - Re-order nodes by dragging and dropping onto another node: you will see a red dotted highlight around the target node.
  - You can drag images from files or other web pages into the map, either into existing nodes, or into open space to create new nodes.
  - You can drag `.mup` files or `.json` files (which contain the `.mup` data structure) into a container to paste the file contents.
    - ISSUE: Only supports the same features as paste, so does not currently support links or themes.
- `alt+click` on a node adds a link from your currently selected node to the clicked node.
- Clicking on a link icon opens up the url in a new tab.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The map must have keyboard focus for these to work:

| Key Combination | Normal Horizontal Maps | Top-Down Maps |
|-----------------|----------------------------|---|
`return`  | Add sibling node after | Add child node after
`shift+return` | Add sibling node before | Add parent node
`.` `insert`  | Add child node | Insert sibling node after
`,` | Insert parent node | Insert sibling node before

| Key Combination | Effect |
|-----------------|---|
`shift+return` *while editing node text* | Start new line of text
