MindMup MapJs
=============

MindMup is a zero-friction mind map canvas. Our aim is to create the most productive mind mapping environment out there, removing all the distractions and providing powerful editing shortcuts. 

This project is the JavaScript visualisation portion of MindMup. It provides a canvas for users to create and edit
mind maps in a browser. You can see an example of this live at [mindmup.com](http://www.mindmup.com), or play with the library directly in the browser using `test/index.html` from this project..

This project is relatively stand alone and you can use it to create a nice mind map visualisation separate from the 
[MindMup Server](https://www.mindmup.com).
