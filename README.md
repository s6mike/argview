# MapJs Argview

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0cc8f19e-a2a6-423b-a105-69b283851eac/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mapjs-argview/deploys)

<https://mapjs-argview.netlify.app/> is a simple adaptation of the [mapjs](https://github.com/mindmup/mapjs) mind map app for the purpose of viewing argument maps. Currently these can only be loaded and saved locally.

## Dependencies

This library depends on the following projects:

- [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Underscore.Js](http://underscorejs.org/)
- [JQuery HotKeys](http://jquery.com/)
- [Hammer.JS JQuery Plugin](http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js)
- [Color JS](https://github.com/harthur/color)

As of 11 Feb 23, it runs with the latest versions of all of these, except [Hammer.JS JQuery Plugin](http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js) v2.0.0, which requires an insecure version of jQuery, so instead uses v1.1.3.

## Node Selection

- You can only select one node at a time, selected nodes have a drop shadow.
  - When you add nodes they are added relative to th selected node.
- You can activate multiple nodes at once, these are highlighted with a dotted line.
  - When you delete or toggle nodes, this affects all active nodes.

## Node Editing

- New nodes automatically give you text focus so you can start adding its initial text.
- Clicking on a node twice lets you edit the node's text.
- Typing in a url will add a clickable link icon to the node allowing you to open that url in another tab. The url's text will not be displayed in the node except when editing it.
- You can add an image to a node by dragging a file or web page image into it.

## Links

- Links are arbitrary straight line connections between nodes that are not part of the tree structure.
- You can create them with `alt+click` or with the `add link` toolbar button.
- You can select links by clicking on them:
  - This displays the Edit Link buttons underneath the main toolbar buttons:
    - These can be used to delete the link or change their colour, style or toggle an arrow.
  - The selected link is highlighted with a dotted purple line.

## Mouse Operations

- Click inside a node to select it.
- Click twice inside a node to edit the text.
- `shift+click`: Activates a node.
- Menu Toolbar at top has buttons for a number of operations, yet to be documented.
- Dragging and dropping:
  - Root nodes only: drag into an open space to re-position.
  - Child nodes: Make it into a new root node by dragging it into open space.
  - Re-order nodes by dragging and dropping onto another node: you will see a red dotted highlight around the target node.
  - You can drag images from files or other web pages into the map, either into existing nodes, or into open space to create new nodes.
  - You can drag `.mup` files or `.json` files (which contain the `.mup` data structure) into a container to paste the file contents.
    - ISSUE: Only supports the same features as paste, so does not currently support links or themes.
- `alt+click` on a node adds a link from your currently selected node to the clicked node.
- Clicking on a link icon opens up the url in a new tab.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The map must have keyboard focus for these to work:

`return`  | Add sibling node after | Add child node after
`shift+return` | Add sibling node before | Add parent node
`.` `insert`  | Add child node | Insert sibling node after
`,` | Insert parent node | Insert sibling node before

| Key Combination | Effect |
